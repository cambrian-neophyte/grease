# Grease script collection

I will try to collect scripts that have been, or will become, useful to me, in this repository.

# Dependencies

* Ruby


# Installation

There is an install script that will create symlinks in ~/.local/bin/ to the files in the script folder.
Alternatively, you can copy scripts to your favorite location.
